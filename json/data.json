Total words was a stat that we really wanted to include in our statâ€™s page, and we couldnâ€™t find an easy way to calculate it. The text editor we used (Tiny MCE) stores all of the text area input as HTML, and actually had a built-in method for calculating total words, but only on a per entry basis. We ended up using a custom regex expression to capture the word count of each journal entry, and summing the total count across all entries to give us the figure we wanted.</ul>",
